Do you want to suggest to your users that they can do more than just scrolling? Enter BMAGridPageControl.

BMAGridPageControl is designed to be really similar to UIPageControl. You control it specifying a total number of items, and a current item. The control will highlight the current item as it was inside a grid.

###Testing
While developing this small control, we also wanted to check how you would apply TDD to it. We came out with a two-class implementation: A driver and the control itself. Check the sources and tell us what you think!

##Installation
Use cocoapods, or copy the files in BMAGridPageControl folder to your project.
